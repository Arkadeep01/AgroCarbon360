📌 Detailed Backend Report for backend/
1. src/ — Core Backend Code

This is the heart of the system.
You’ll likely use Python (FastAPI/Django REST), but I’ll also mention if Node.js (Express/Nest.js) is an alternative.

🔑 auth/ → Authentication & Access Control

Handles user onboarding, login, and secure access.

models.py → Database models for User, Roles, Permissions, Tokens

routes.py → API endpoints (/login, /register, /refresh-token)

auth_service.py → Business logic (JWT creation, password hashing, OAuth2)

permissions.py → Role-based access control (farmer, FPO, auditor, admin)

schemas.py → Pydantic/serializer classes for user data validation

⚡ Options:

JWT (stateless) or Session-based auth

Role-based vs Attribute-based access control

Integration with Aadhaar/India Stack for rural authentication

👨‍🌾 farmer/ → Farmer Data Ingestion APIs

Handles farmer profile creation and field data submission.

farmer_api.py → Endpoints (/farmer/register, /farmer/field-data)

forms.py → Input validators (land size, crop type, location)

farmer_service.py → Logic to clean, store, and map farmer data

schemas.py → Farmer data models (JSON, DB schemas)

⚡ Options:

Simple CRUD vs Advanced APIs with offline sync

Geo-tagging integration (GeoJSON, PostGIS)

🏢 fpo/ → Farmer Producer Organization Dashboard APIs

APIs powering the FPO/co-op dashboards.

dashboard_api.py → Endpoints (/fpo/overview, /fpo/reports)

fpo_service.py → Business logic (aggregating farmer data, yields)

analytics.py → Basic stats (crop yield trends, emission summary)

⚡ Options:

REST API (simpler) or GraphQL API (flexible for dashboards)

Aggregation in DB (PostgreSQL) vs on-demand

🌍 carbon_engine/ → Carbon Accounting Algorithms

Implements IPCC-compliant carbon models.

ipcc_methods.py → Functions for Tier 1/2 methods (CH₄, N₂O, CO₂eq)

emission_factors.json → Default IPCC factors, region-specific updates

carbon_service.py → Core logic:

Rice methane emissions

Agroforestry biomass sequestration

Uncertainty quantification

schemas.py → Data models for emission records

⚡ Options:

Pure Python (NumPy/Pandas)

Link with ML models (from ml_models/)

✅ verification/ → Auditor/Verifier APIs

For 3rd-party validation & audit transparency.

audit_api.py → Endpoints (/verification/reports, /verification/samples)

verifier_tools.py → Logic for random field sampling, cross-checks

checklist.json → Audit templates (aligned with Verra, Gold Standard)

schemas.py → Structures for reports & approvals

⚡ Options:

API to fetch immutable blockchain logs

Export reports in PDF/Excel

🔗 blockchain/ → Blockchain/Immutable Records

Ensures tamper-proof MRV records.

ledger_client.py → API connector to blockchain (Hyperledger, Ethereum, Polygon)

transactions.py → Functions to record carbon credits, farmer IDs

state_channel.py → Optional: For low-connectivity syncing

config.json → Blockchain network config

⚡ Options:

Hyperledger Fabric (permissioned, enterprise)

Polygon/Ethereum (public, token-based credits)

🛠️ utils/ → Reusable Utilities

General helpers used across modules.

helpers.py → Common functions (date formatting, file handling)

validators.py → Input validation rules (geo-coords, crop codes)

logger.py → Centralized logging (structured logs)

config_loader.py → Loads .env and configs

⚡ Options:

Use pydantic or voluptuous for validation

Centralized logging with ELK/Prometheus

2. tests/

Unit & integration tests for backend.

test_auth.py → Token validation, login/logout

test_farmer.py → Farmer API CRUD ops

test_carbon_engine.py → Validate emission outputs

test_blockchain.py → Transaction immutability

conftest.py → Pytest fixtures (DB mock, API client)

⚡ Options:

Use pytest (Python) or jest (Node.js)

Mock satellite data/IoT feeds

4. Dockerfile

Containerizes backend service.

Multi-stage build (slim Python/Node base)

Installs dependencies

Runs backend server (uvicorn main:app or node server.js)

Exposes port (default 8000 for FastAPI, 3000 for Node)

⚡ Options:

Add GPU support for ML inference

Alpine image for lightweight builds

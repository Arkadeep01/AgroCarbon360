1. data_preprocessing/ → Cleaning & Normalizing Inputs
Handles raw inputs from farmers, IoT devices, and satellites.
cleaning.py → Remove duplicates, missing values, outliers
normalization.py → Scale features (z-score, min-max)
geo_processing.py → Convert satellite data (GeoTIFF → NumPy arrays)
augment.py → Synthetic data creation (for low-data farmers)
📌 Example: Convert farmer field size (acres) + satellite NDVI into standardized inputs for ML.


2. feature_engineering/ → Creating Features
Transforms raw data into meaningful features for ML models.
climate_features.py → Extract rainfall, temperature, soil moisture trends
agri_features.py → Crop cycle length, irrigation patterns
carbon_features.py → Biomass growth indicators, residue management features
spatial_features.py → GIS features like field polygon area, buffer zones
📌 Example: Create “methane_risk_index” from soil type + irrigation frequency.


3. model_training/ → ML/DL Training Pipelines
Where models are trained & validated.
train_emission_model.py → Predicts CH₄/N₂O/CO₂eq from farm data
train_yield_model.py → Estimates crop yield (supports FPO dashboard)
train_remote_sensing_model.py → Classifies crop types from satellite imagery
trainer.py → Generalized training loop (cross-validation, logging)
configs/ → YAML/JSON configs for hyperparams
📌 Example: Train Random Forest or XGBoost for carbon credit estimation.


4. inference/ → Serving Predictions
Real-time/Batch prediction services used by the backend.
predict_emissions.py → Given farmer data → returns CO₂eq estimate
predict_yield.py → Farmer’s expected crop yield
predict_land_use.py → From Sentinel/Landsat image → classify land use
batch_inference.py → Runs predictions for all farmers in FPO
📌 Example: Backend calls this when a farmer submits new data → returns instant carbon footprint.


5. monitoring/ → Model Health & Drift Detection
Ensures models remain accurate over time.
data_drift.py → Checks if new farmer/satellite data distribution has shifted
performance_tracking.py → Logs accuracy, RMSE, F1-score
alerting.py → Sends alert if accuracy drops (retrain needed)
📌 Example: If rainfall patterns drastically change → trigger retraining.


6. explainability/ → Transparent AI (XAI)
Important for auditor trust & farmer transparency.
shap_analysis.py → Feature importance per prediction
lime_explainer.py → Local interpretable model explanations
report_generator.py → Creates “why” reports (for auditors, in PDF/JSON)
📌 Example: “70% of your methane emissions come from waterlogged paddy fields.”


7. saved_models/ → Trained Models Storage
Organized storage of final trained models.
emission_model_v1.pkl
yield_model_v1.joblib
landuse_cnn_v2.h5
metadata.json (model version, training date, metrics)
📌 Example: CarbonEngine always loads the latest stable model here.


8. utils/ → ML Helpers
Reusable utilities for ML tasks.
metrics.py → Custom carbon accounting metrics (e.g., tCO₂eq per acre)
visualization.py → Training curves, feature plots
data_loader.py → Load farmer + satellite datasets
config_loader.py → Loads ML configs safely


9. tests/ → ML Unit Tests
Tests for ML workflows.
test_preprocessing.py → Ensures no data leakage
test_training.py → Checks reproducibility of models
test_inference.py → Validates outputs are within realistic ranges
test_explainability.py → Ensures explanations are generated
📌 Example: Ensure methane emissions never return negative values.

## 🔗 Integration Points

1. **IoT → Backend**: Gateway forwards sensor data to `/api/iot/readings`
2. **ML → Backend**: Trained models serve predictions via `/api/ml/estimate/*`
3. **FL → Backend**: Federated learning syncs via `/api/fl/*` endpoints
4. **Blockchain → MRV**: Carbon credits minted via configured contract
5. **Data Pipeline → All**: Orchestrator feeds processed data to all components

## 📊 System Status
